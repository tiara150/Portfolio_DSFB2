```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("easyGgplot2", "kassambara")
library(easyGgplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
```
First we are going to download the dataset with the read_excel tool
```{r import, echo=FALSE}
C_elegans <- read_excel ("Tidydata_C.xlsx")

```
after that we are using the scatterplot tool to visualize the data.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot2.scatterplot(data=C_elegans, xName='compConcentration',yName='DataRaw', 
                    addRegLine=TRUE, regLineColor="blue")
```
Correct the data-type of compConcentration to numeric and than look at the graph again. Use a log10 transformation on the x-axis to get a clear graph. Also, add a bit of jitter to the points in the graph so that points are not overlapping.
```{r}

```
