my work plan:

1. excersizing with shiny app during master class and with other websites (1-2 days)

2. finding a dataset which I will use for my own app. I am going to use the dataset I also use during Projecticum. This is helpful for my skills during Projecticum. (0,5 day)

3. now I have enough information to actually build my Shiny App. I am going to make an app which is very easy to understand but has different analytical plots and graphs. (2-3 days)

My recources:
