## About me

I am a hardworking student with an eye for detail and a passion for biomedical research. I like to show my creative side when working on research. My strong qualities are my perseverance, accuracy, thinking in solutions, my social skills and my honesty.

## My long term goals

I am currently working on obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Sciences. In the future, I plan to find a challenging job in Research and would like to find a job where I can further develop myself in data science.

Job Experience
----------

**Administrative Staff Member - ABN AMRO Bank**

Perform administrative work in various systems. In addition, I have mail contact with customers regarding questions about their contract. 

**Manager in a restaurant**

Opening and closing the building, managing colleagues and helping guests with problems. 


## Previous research

**Project Lectorate**
This is my latest project. I am building a script where data sets from a transcription analysis can be downloaded via a simple function and then a coun matrix can be made. We finally developed a function that performs a quantification analysis from a simple link to the datasets and provides this document in orderly folders. This is very useful for researchers without programming experience.

**Project Genes & proteins**
This research was about the role of the immune system during a viral infection. The aim was to find out more about Interleukin-8, which plays a role in the infection with the RS virus. 

**Project Pharmacon**
This research focused on the effect of the pharmaceutical compound Lithium on the C. Elegans in relation to Alzheimer's disease. We had to study the brain activity of the C.elegans before and after adding Lithium. 

**Project Molecular Biology**
With this project, we addressed the research question "does cortisol have a greater stimulating effect on the rat glucocorticoid receptor than the human glucocorticoid receptor?". to answer this research question, a Westernblot was performed to determine the presence of the GR receptor. then a fluorescence assay was performed to determine the translocation of the fusion protein. finally, a luciferase assay was performed to determine the transactivation of the GR receptor.

**Project Biomolecular Research**
This research was on behalf of Nutricia Science. We dealt with the absorption of the fatty acids EPA and DHA in muscle cells for muscle diseases. It also examined where the fatty acids go after absorption. We used a HPLC-MS to study where the fatty acids went.


Technical Experience
--------------------

Building my own Shiny App
:   I am currently working on my own shiny app. 


Programming Languages
:   **R** R is what I use most for programming. I have been working with R for about 6 months now and I have had several assignments on R. These can also be found on my Github page. (link below).
:   **bash** I am also familiar with programming in Bash, but I can learn a bit more about it.
