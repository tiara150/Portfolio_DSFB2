# Portfolio_DSFB2
This file contains my current portfolio from the course Data Science for Biology.

during this course I made scripts and developped my programming skills. And this Github Page contains the scripts I made and other assignments.

A little introduction for what you can expect from my github page:

1. Capstone assignment: this is the assignment from a previous course. We made a rmardkdown file which contains different programming tasks.

2. My Shiny app: This folder contains my work plan for my free time and the Shiny app I am building.

3. Shiny_app_examples: this is a folder I made during the Masterclass, I used this for my shiny excersizes.

4. Assignment 1: This folder contains an assignment for a C.Elegens Plate Experiment, I made different Plots for an experiment output (dataset).

5. Assignment 3: This folder contains my current resum√©. I am still working on the lay out but the text is complete.

6. Assignment 5: This file contains an introduction to my Projecticum.  

7. Assignment 6: This folder contains my long term goals.

## My workplan

**Why Shiny App?**

I had to work with shiny for the first time during the master classes and the projecticum. After the masterclass, I didn't feel like I understood everything about Shiny, so I was often looking up examples and trying to understand them better. Therefore, I chose to spend the 4 days we had to learn more about Shiny in relation to our project.

**Spending the first 2 days practising**

Because I am already familiar with Shiny App, I don't need a lot of time to do research. The website I found is actually a deepening of the master class, so it helped me a lot (1)(2). I needed 1-2 days to finish this master class. 

**Building my own Shiny App**

After practising with Shiny, it is really time to start making my own Shiny App. I plan to use the dataset we have for our project as input for my Shiny App. I plan to look up summarized experiments from similar datasets to make sure this dataset looks the same. Once this is done, I plan to dissect different Shiny apps and look at the graphs and tables used. I will then use these for my datasets as well. 

**What will my Shiny App look like?**

I want my Shiny app to be clear, so I'll be adding lots of comments. I also want to make an app with more difficult graphs instead of tables, because I find graphs more of a challenge. For the type of dataset I have chosen (transcription analysis) I would like to add heat maps and vulcano plots because I see these are used more often for transcription analysis.
