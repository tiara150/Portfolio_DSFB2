# Portfolio_DSFB2
This file contains my current portfolio from the course Data Science for Biology.

during this course I made scripts and developped my programming skills. And this Github Page contains the scripts I made and other assignments.

1. Capstone assignment: this is the assignment from a previous course. We made a rmardkdown file which contains different programming tasks. 

2. My app: this is the file I use to practise Shiny App and to make my own Shiny App!

3. Shiny_app_examples: this is a folder I made during the Masterclass, used this for my shiny excersizes.

4. Curriculum_Vitae: This is my current resum√©. I am still working on the lay out but the text is complete.
